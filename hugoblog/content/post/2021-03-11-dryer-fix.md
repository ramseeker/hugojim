The dryer crapped out on us. It's actually still working but squeeks like no tomorrow. I have gone to [youtube university](http://youtube.com) and found a video showing me how to fix it so that's the task for this weekend I guess.

I bought [this part](https://amzn.to/3bBCd5B) for it. At about $10, I figure I don't have much to lose by fixing it myself.
